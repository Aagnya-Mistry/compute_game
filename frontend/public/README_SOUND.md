# Ambient Sound Setup

To add background ambient sound to the game:

1. Place an audio file named `ambient.mp3` in this directory (`frontend/public/`)
2. The game will automatically attempt to play it in the background
3. Recommended: Use a sci-fi ambient/atmospheric sound (3-5 minutes, looped)
4. If the file is not present, the game will continue to work without sound

The audio file should be:

- Format: MP3 (recommended) or other web-compatible format
- Duration: 30 seconds to 5 minutes (will be looped)
- Volume: The game sets volume to 30% by default
